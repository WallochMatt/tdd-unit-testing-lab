Introduction to TDD



	Main Stories

As a DevOps professional, I will create two testing suites (.test.js files), one for each group of functions (math and string). 
You should have 2 suites at a minimum, one for each component/function group:
	math functions
	string functions

As a DevOps professional, I will group my tests using the “describe” command with an appropriate description. 
	
	For the math functions you should have a minimum of four groups:
		add tests
		divide tests
		multiply tests
		subtract tests

	For the string functions you should have a minimum of three groups:
		capitalization tests
		concatenation tests
		second word tests

As a DevOps professional, for each function I will write at least  one “true positive” and one “true negative” test.

As a DevOps professional, I will run all tests before writing code, take a screenshot of the FAILED tests and post in the instructor slack channel.

TDD Step 2+: As a DevOps professional, I will iteratively write code for each function until I pass the test.

NOTE: The results of your test assertion may be hardcoded! - This is common for testing as we want to compare to a known and expected result.

	Bonus Stories

As a DevOps professional, I will use the App.test.js as an example and add additional tests that will find and compare a new element of your name . (Use the resources listed below for the best syntax/methods.)
